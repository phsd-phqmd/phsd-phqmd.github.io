The hadronization of an expanding partonic fireball is studied within the Parton-Hadron-Strings Dynamics (PHSD) approach which is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) matched to reproduce lattice QCD results in thermodynamic equilibrium. Apart from strong parton interactions the expansion and development of collective flow is driven by strong gradients in the parton mean-fields. An analysis of the elliptic flow $v_2$ demonstrates a linear correlation with the spatial eccentricity $\epsilon$ as in case of ideal hydrodynamics. The hadronization occurs by quark-antiquark fusion or 3 quark/3 antiquark recombination which is described by covariant transition rates. Since the dynamical quarks become very massive, the formed resonant 'pre-hadronic' color-dipole states ($q\bar{q}$ or $qqq$) are of high invariant mass, too, and sequentially decay to the groundstate meson and baryon octets increasing the total entropy. This solves the entropy problem in hadronization in a natural way. The resulting particle ratios turn out to be in line with those from a grandcanonical partition function at temperature $T \approx 170$ MeV rather independent from the initial temperature and indicate an approximate strangeness equilibration.

The dynamics of partons, hadrons and strings in relativistic nucleus–nucleus collisions is analyzed within the novel Parton–Hadron–String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach, which is based on a Dynamical QuasiParticle Model (DQPM) for partons matched to reproduce recent lattice-QCD results – including the partonic equation of state – in thermodynamic equilibrium. Scalar- and vector-interaction densities are extracted from the DQPM as well as effective scalar- and vector-mean fields for the partons. The transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark–antiquark pairs or three quarks (antiquarks), respectively, obeying flavor current-conservation, color neutrality as well as energy–momentum conservation. Since the dynamical quarks and antiquarks become very massive close to the phase transition, the formed resonant ‘pre-hadronic’ color-dipole states ($q\bar{q}$ or $qqq$) are of high invariant mass, too, and sequentially decay to the groundstate meson and baryon octets increasing the total entropy. The PHSD approach is applied to nucleus–nucleus collisions from 20 to 160 A GeV in order to explore the space–time regions of ‘partonic matter’. We find that even central collisions at the top-SPS energy of 158 A GeV show a large fraction of non-partonic, i.e. hadronic or string-like matter, which can be viewed as a hadronic corona. This finding implies that neither hadronic nor only partonic ‘models’ can be employed to extract physical conclusions in comparing model results with data. On the other hand – studying in detail Pb + Pb reactions from 40 to 158 A GeV – we observe that the partonic phase has a very low impact on rapidity distributions of hadrons but a sizeable influence on the transverse mass distribution of final kaons due to the repulsive partonic mean fields. Furthermore, we find a significant effect on the production of multi-strange antibaryons due to a slightly enhanced $s\bar{s}$ pair production in the partonic phase from massive time-like gluon decay and a larger formation of antibaryons in the hadronization process.

This review provides a written version of the lectures presented at the Schladming Winter School 2008, Austria, on 'Nonequilibrium Aspects of Quantum Field Theory'. In particular, it shows the way from quantum-field theory - in two-particle irreducible approximation - to the Kadanoff-Baym (KB) equations and various approximations schemes of the KB equations in phase space. This ultimately leads to the formulation of an off-shell transport theory that well incorporates the underlying quantum physics. Remarkably, these transport equations may be solved within a testparticle representation that allows to study non-equilibrium quantum systems in the weak and strong coupling regime. Actual applications to dilepton production in heavy-ion reactions are presented in comparison with available data. The approach, furthermore, allows to address the hadronization process from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom.

The novel Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach is applied to nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC energies with respect to differential hadronic spectra in comparison to available data. The PHSD approach is based on a dynamical quasiparticle model for partons (DQPM) matched to reproduce recent lattice-QCD results from the Wuppertal-Budapest group in thermodynamic equilibrium. The transition from partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom is described by covariant transition rates for the fusion of quark-antiquark pairs or three quarks (antiquarks), respectively, obeying flavor current-conservation, color neutrality as well as energy-momentum conservation. Our dynamical studies for heavy-ion collisions at relativistic collider energies are compared to earlier results from the Hadron-String Dynamics (HSD) approach - incorporating no explicit dynamical partonic phase - as well as to experimental data from the STAR, PHENIX, BRAHMS and PHOBOS collaborations for Au+Au collisions at the top RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s}= 200$ GeV. We find a reasonable reproduction of hadron rapidity distributions and transverse mass spectra and also a fair description of the elliptic flow of charged hadrons as a function of the centrality of the reaction and the transverse momentum $p_T$. Furthermore, an approximate quark-number scaling of the elliptic flow $v_2$ of hadrons is observed in the PHSD results, too.

**Rise of azimuthal anisotropies as a signature of the Quark-Gluon-Plasma in relativistic heavy-ion collisions**

The azimuthal anisotropies of the collective transverse flow of hadrons are investigated in a large range of heavy-ion collision energy within the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) microscopic transport approach which incorporates explicit partonic degrees of freedom in terms of strongly interacting quasiparticles (quarks and gluons) in line with an equation-of-state from lattice QCD as well as dynamical hadronization and hadronic dynamics in the final reaction phase. The experimentally observed increase of the elliptic flow $v_2$ bombarding energy is successfully described in terms of the PHSD approach in contrast to a variety of other kinetic models based on hadronic interactions. The analysis of higher-order harmonics $v_3$ and $v_4$ shows a similar tendency of growing deviations between partonic and purely hadronic models with increasing bombarding energy. This signals that the excitation functions of azimuthal anisotropies provide a sensitive probe for the underling degrees of freedom excited in heavy-ion collisions.

**Shear and bulk viscosities of strongly interacting “infinite” parton-hadron matter within the parton-hadron-string dynamics transport approach**

We study the shear and bulk viscosities of partonic and hadronic matter as functions of temperature $T$ within the parton-hadron-string dynamics (PHSD) off-shell transport approach. Dynamical hadronic and partonic systems in equilibrium are studied by the PHSD simulations in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions. The ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density $\eta(T)/s(T)$ from PHSD shows a minimum (with a value of about 0.1) close to the critical temperature $T_c$, while it approaches the perturbative QCD limit at higher temperatures in line with lattice QCD (lQCD) results. For $T < T_c$, in the hadronic phase, the ratio $\eta/s$ rises fast with decreasing temperature due to a strong decrease of the entropy density $s$ in the hadronic phase at decreasing $T$. Within statistics, we obtain practically the same results in the Kubo formalism and in the relaxation time approximation. The bulk viscosity $\zeta(T)$ - evaluated in the relaxation time approach - is found to strongly depend on the effects of mean fields (or potentials) in the partonic phase. We find a significant rise of the ratio $\zeta(T)/s(T)$ in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$, when consistently including the scalar mean-field from PHSD, which is also in agreement with that from lQCD calculations. Furthermore, we present the results for the ratio $(\eta+ 3\zeta/4)/s$, which is found to depend nontrivially on temperature and to generally agree with the lQCD calculations as well. Within the PHSD calculations, the strong maximum of $\zeta(T)/\eta(T)$ close to $T_c$ has to be attributed to mean-field (or potential) effects that in PHSD are encoded in the temperature dependence of the quasiparticle masses, which is related to the infrared enhancement of the resummed (effective) coupling $g(T)$.

We study charm production in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions by using the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach. The initial charm quarks are produced by the Pythia event generator tuned to fit the transverse momentum spectrum and rapidity distribution of charm quarks from Fixed-Order Next-to-Leading Logarithm (FONLL) calculations. The produced charm quarks scatter in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) with the off-shell partons whose masses and widths are given by the Dynamical Quasi-Particle Model (DQPM) which reproduces the lattice QCD equation-of-state in thermal equilibrium. The relevant cross section are calculated in a consistent way by employing the effective propagators and couplings from the DQPM. Close to the critical energy density of the phase transition, the charm quarks are hadronized into $D$ mesons through coalescence and/or fragmentation depending on transverse momentum. The hadronized $D$ mesons then interact with the various hadrons in the hadronic phase with cross sections calculated in an effective lagrangian approach with heavy-quark spin symmetry. Finally, the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and the elliptic flow $v_2$ of $D^0$ mesons from PHSD are compared with the experimental data from the STAR Collaboration for Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. We find that in the PHSD the energy loss of $D$ mesons at high $p_T$ can be dominantly attributed to partonic scattering while the actual shape of $R_{AA}$ versus $p_T$ reflects the heavy quark hadronization scenario, i.e. coalescence versus fragmentation. Also the hadronic rescattering is important for the $R_{AA}$ at low $p_T$ and enhances the D-meson elliptic flow $v_2$.

We study the production of strange hadrons in nucleus-nucleus collisions from 4 to 160 A GeV within the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach that is extended to incorporate essentials aspects of chiral symmetry restoration (CSR) in the hadronic sector (via the Schwinger mechanism) on top of the deconfinement phase transition as implemented in PHSD. Especially the $K^+/π^+$ and the $(\Lambda^+\Sigma^0)/\pi^-$ ratios in central Au+Au collisions are found to provide information on the relative importance of both transitions. The modelling of chiral symmetry restoration is driven by the pion-nucleon $\Sigma$-term in the computation of the quark scalar condensate <$q\bar{q}$> that serves as an order parameter for CSR and also scales approximately with the effective quark masses ms and mq. Furthermore, the nucleon scalar density $\rho_s$, which also enters the computation of <$q\bar{q}$>, is evaluated within the nonlinear $\sigma - \omega$ model which is constraint by Dirac-Brueckner calculations and low energy heavy-ion reactions. The Schwinger mechanism (for string decay) fixes the ratio of strange to light quark production in the hadronic medium. We find that above $\sim$ 80 A GeV the reaction dynamics of heavy nuclei is dominantly driven by partonic degrees-of-freedom such that traces of the chiral symmetry restoration are hard to identify. Our studies support the conjecture of 'quarkyonic matter' in heavy-ion collisions from about 5 to 40 A GeV and provide a microscopic explanation for the maximum in the $K^+/π^+$ ratio at about 30 A GeV which only shows up if a transition to partonic degrees-of-freedom is incorporated in the reaction dynamics and is discarded in the traditional hadron-string models.

In this review we address the dynamics of relativistic heavy-ion reactions and in particular the information obtained from electromagnetic probes that stem from the partonic and hadronic phases. The out-of-equilibrium description of strongly interacting relativistic fields is based on the theory of Kadanoff and Baym. For the modeling of the partonic phase we introduce a dynamical quasiparticle model (DQPM) for QCD in equilibrium. The widths and masses of the quasiparticles are controlled by transport coefficients in comparison to lattice QCD results. The resulting off-shell transport approach - denoted by Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) - also includes covariant dynamical hadronization and keeps track of the hadronic interactions in the final phase. We show that PHSD captures the bulk dynamics of heavy-ion collisions from SPS to LHC energies and provides a basis for the evaluation of the electromagnetic emissivity, using the same dynamical parton propagators as for the system evolution. Direct photon production in elementary processes and heavy-ion reactions at RHIC and LHC energies is investigated and the status of the photon $v_2$ puzzle - a large elliptic flow of the direct photons observed in A+A collisions - is addressed. We discuss the roles of hadronic and partonic sources for the photon spectra and the flow coefficients $v_2$ and $v_3$ and also the possibility to subtract the QGP signal from observables. Furthermore, the production of dilepton pairs is addressed from SIS to LHC energies. The low-mass dilepton yield is enhanced due to the in-medium modification of the rho-meson and at the lowest energy also due to a multiple regeneration of Delta-resonances. In addition, a signal of the partonic degrees-of-freedom is found in the intermediate dilepton mass regime (1.2 GeV < M < 3 GeV), which can shed light on the nature of the very early degrees-of-freedom in nucleus-nucleus collisions.

We extend the Parton-Hadron-String Dynamics (PHSD) transport approach in the partonic sector by explicitly calculating the total and differential partonic scattering cross sections as a function of temperature $T$ and baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ on the basis of the effective propagators and couplings from the Dynamical QuasiParticle Model (DQPM) that is matched to reproduce the equation of state of the partonic system above the deconfinement temperature $T_c$ from lattice QCD. The ratio of shear viscosity $\eta$ over entropy density $s$, i.e. $\eta/s$, is evaluated using the collisional widths and compared to lQCD calculations for $\mu_B = 0$ as well. We find only a very modest change of $\eta/s$ with the baryon chemical $\mu_B$. This also holds for a variety of hadronic observables from central A+A and C+Au collisions in the energy range 5 GeV $\sqrt{s_{NN}} \le 200$ GeV when implementing the differential cross sections into the PHSD approach. We only observe small differences in the strangeness and antibaryon sector with practically no sensitivity of rapidity and $p_T$ distributions to the $\mu_B$ dependence of the partonic cross sections. Since we find only small traces of a $\mu_B$-dependence in heavy-ion observables - although the effective partonic masses and widths as well as their partonic cross sections clearly depend on $\mu_B$ - this implies that one needs a sizable partonic density and large space-time QGP volume to explore the dynamics in the partonic phase. These conditions are only fulfilled at high bombarding energies where $\mu_B$ is, however, rather low. On the other hand, when decreasing the bombarding energy and thus increasing $\mu_B$, the hadronic phase becomes dominant and accordingly, it will be difficult to extract signals from the partonic dynamics based on "bulk" observables.
